\section{Introduction}
In the age of the mythical "Big Data," many data sources produce information at an increasingly high rate.  Oftentimes, this data must be processed immediately for the information to have any value.  Streaming systems are an efficient way to process and analyze ever-changing data in real time.  

Commercialized streaming systems have been considered the industry standard for over a decade.  More recently however, several open-source streaming systems have become increasingly popular.  Systems such as Apache Spark, Twitter Storm, and Yahoo S4 are all similar in function and often compared to one another.  However, rarely are these systems directly benchmarked against commercial systems.  In this paper, we seek to execute a fair, direct comparison between the foremost research systems and an industry-leading commercial system.
