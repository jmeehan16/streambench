\section{Conclusions}
We compared the performance of two modern main-memory streaming systems: the open-source Apache Spark and an industry standard, commercial System-X.  We found that Spark lived up to the expected performance on both the Wordcount and Grep benchmarks, and also scaled linearly as advertised.  The performance of System-X paled in comparison to Spark on these specific benchmarks, as it was unable to handle even a fraction of the throughput.  These evaluations exhibit preliminary results, and provide a strong starting point for a full system comparison.
